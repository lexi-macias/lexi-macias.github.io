### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 is one of my favorites because it was the first lab part that I programmed
    using user input to give an adaptable output in the C++ language. I learned provide text
    prompts for a user, save their input in a variable, and then give the user readable output
    that changes depending on the initial input. Overall, I liked being able to form print
    statements with both string literals and string variables.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 is a favorite because it mimicked the game of Blackjack with several if
    conditional statements, function definitions and calls, and multiple .cc files separate
    sections of code. I learned how to play the game of Blackjack based on each line of code
    focused on calculations and point value assignment. In this way, I liked accessing functions
    and command line arguments in order to efficiently determine the total score of a playerâ€™s
    hand for a real card game.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 is a favorite of mine because this is the first lab part that I programmed
    using Magick++.h for creating images and animations in the C++ language. I learned how to
    apply my knowledge of images in order to create an actual moving animation similar to a .gif.
    After all, I liked learning how to use lines of code to create several images to make up one
    large moving picture, especially the section of code that focuses on the color and size each
    image.
